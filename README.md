## **Project Description**

The **Library Room Monitoring and Control System** is an Android-based application that allows students to monitor the availability of walk-in study rooms on campus in real-time. The system uses sensors to track occupancy, room temperature, and air quality to provide students with a comfortable and informed study environment. Students can also control the air conditioning system in each room after authenticating their presence via QR codes or check-in codes.



### **Key Features**:

- **Real-Time Room Availability**: Track room occupancy in real-time using human presence sensors and distance sensors.

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor the temperature and air quality for each study room and display it in the app.

- **Air Conditioning Control**: Users can control the air conditioning in rooms through secure authentication.

- **Building Navigation**: Easily switch between different campus buildings and check the status of all study rooms.
